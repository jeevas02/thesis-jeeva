\chapter{Abstract}

In the massive field of professional soccer, statistical analysis has become a pivotal tool used across facets of the sport, such as player performance analysis, team strategy, player development, and so on. While there are a number of studies that have been done on the landscape of statistical analysis in soccer, there is little data available that provides a sound analysis of the plethora of variables within the sport and the different ways in which they can be analyzed. This thesis integrates methodologies from various statistical studies to analyze key performance indicators within \keyword{descriptive}, \keyword{comparative}, \keyword{predictive}, and \keyword{contextual} variable groups across a variety of leagues and environments across the globe. We observe that these \keyword{KPIs}
interplay to shape match outcomes. By taking a closer look into the unique methodologies and analysis methods used, including advanced predictive modeling and regression analysis, this thesis will allow for the examination of the complex relationships between a variety of KPIs and match outcomes across different soccer environments. The outcomes contribute a refined understanding of soccer analytics and their growing effectiveness, while also providing actionable strategies for enhancing team performance in varying league contexts.
